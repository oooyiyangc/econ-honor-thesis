**Tax Revenue Cyclicality and Income Inequality: Evidence from U.S. Counties From 1989 to 2019**  

**Yiyang Chen**  

Tax revenue is known to be pro-cyclical--it increases when the economy is booming, and falls when a recession takes over. It is important to understand the exact dynamics of these cyclical fluctuations of tax revenue as many offerings of the public goods, on top of other things, depend on government budget, especially on a local level. Therefore, it is worthwhile to consider various factors that may have either strengthen or lessen the impact of business cycles on government tax revenue. 

In my paper, I will examine how income inequality may associate with the cyclicality of tax revenue chiefly using U.S. county individual income tax data from 1989-2019. I will perform a panel regression analysis looking at how tax revenue cyclicality in each county varies by income inequality at the respective location. I find that the effect is significant across counties in the same time period, where counties with higher inequality tend to have a more volatile cyclical fluctuation of local tax revenue. However, it seems the rising income inequality over the past few decades did not result in tax revenue being more sensitive to business cycle.
